DONE - I want a filter sessions by exercise feature.
DONE - I want the database to accept floats for the mass entry.
DONE - Fix the add component for accepting floats as well.
DONE - Fix the add component by removing duplication of code.
DONE - I want the scheme to generate a tonnage data point.
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by session
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by week
    DONE by month

    !!! My mass tonnage formula is massively incorrect.
     - Better to have manual input of tonnage, or to input average mass, average reps per set.
     - But max Mass and actual reps per set is important...
        - I have no accurate mass tonnage except when the scheme is exactly correct... and even then, it wrongly assumes max session weight is one rep max... it must be removed
        

    I want to visualise average quality with average max mass, and average reps/sets.

    ? by input interval
    
    DONE Having to split interval and format multiplies the amount of manual coding, can I fix this?

    Can I remove duplication between the tonnage functions?
        Done some. Probably can do more, but I'll leave them as they are at the moment
    Can I make the displays stackable?

    Visualise tonnage data as a graph?
    Calendar widget.

    ? Limit date range of data fed to tonnage functions.

    How to persist state preferences?

    Auto-fill for add session.

Tonnage:
scheme === linear: reps * sets * mass
scheme === pyramid: mass * 0.8 * 10 + mass * 0.85 * 6 + mass * 0.9 * 3 + mass * 0.95 * 1
reps / sets = 20 / 8 = 2.5  is default, percentage deviation from this ratio is multiplied into the tonnage to approximate mass tonnage. ie Lower rep/set is assumed to mean higher mass, and therefore increases mass tonnage, higher decreases it. Also, reps / 20 multiplies in as well, to reward higher rep tonnage.
Therefore, rep tonnage is accurate, standard pyramid scheme is accurate, tonnage quality is accurate, and mass tonnage is approximate. AND all values are used fruitfully in calculations.
