BUG: After editting a session, the log display order is reset. Fix the Reverse button state.

POTENTIAL ISSUE: The deployed Heroku container of the Server has a CORS allowance for the non-container Server. I meant to point CORS to itself.
    ie. IS "https://node-lifting-history2.herokuapp.com" - SHOULD BE "https://lifting-history-2-container.herokuapp.com"
        Perhaps this is an incorrect assumption on my part. I should experiment with taking it out altogether if it is in fact unnecessary.
