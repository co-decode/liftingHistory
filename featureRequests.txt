BUG: After editting a session, the log display order is reset. Fix the Reverse button state.

POTENTIAL ISSUE: The deployed Heroku container of the Server has a CORS allowance for the non-container Server. I meant to point CORS to itself.
    ie. IS "https://node-lifting-history2.herokuapp.com" - SHOULD BE "https://lifting-history-2-container.herokuapp.com"
        Perhaps this is an incorrect assumption on my part. I should experiment with taking it out altogether if it is in fact unnecessary.


VERSION 3:

    DONE: alter get function to - 1 - rename 'date' to 'sessions' - 2 - dynamically create an exercise call based on existing entries.
            FIXED ERROR: No existing sessions throws an error and crashes server.
    ->> Set up more exercises. Here is the current list:
            BIG ONES:
            - Bench    - Deadlift    - Squat    - Overhead Press    - Bicep    - Tricep    - Grip    - Calf    - Lunge    - Rows    - Shrugs
            - Pull Up    - Push up    - Dips    - Abs    - Lateral Raise    - Good Morning    - Face Pull    - Hip Thrusters    - Hip Abduction
            - Hip Adduction    - Reverse Flies    - Rotator Cuff    - Pull Over    - Neck    - Nordic    - Reverse Nordic    - Leg Curl
            - Flies    - Back Extension    

            And if anything is important enough, I can just make another category...
        ->> NEXT: Add these tables to the database.
        Alter Add component to allow entries into the new tables
        Fix the client side, so that it is looking into the sessions property, not the date
            AND fix the limited exercise call... use that global variable... or construct the array from exercise properties
            (could also send the unique array down from the server... but it shouldn't be too expensive to go Object.keys(get.exercises))
        Alter the Edit components to allow any exercises
        Fix the Tonnage and Graph logic to accumulate correctly.

    Experiment with the Accumulator logic for the Tonnage and Graph components, try to limit the number of times through the whole function to once fo the three datasets.
