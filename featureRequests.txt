DONE - I want a filter sessions by exercise feature.
DONE - I want the database to accept floats for the mass entry.
DONE - Fix the add component for accepting floats as well.
DONE - Fix the add component by removing duplication of code.
DONE - I want the scheme to generate a tonnage data point.
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by session
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by week
    DONE by month

    !!! My mass tonnage formula is massively incorrect.
     DONE Better to have manual input of tonnage, or to input average mass, average reps per set.
    DONE Having to split interval and format multiplies the amount of manual coding, can I fix this?
     
    ? I want to visualise average quality with average max mass, and average reps/sets.

    ? by input interval
    

    ? Can I remove duplication between the tonnage functions?
        Done some. Probably can do more, but I'll leave them as they are at the moment
        
    NEXT: Fix the edit component.
     Finished: The sets input and the reps, mass and variation inputs.
     Next: Fix the add lift fieldset...

    ->> Auto-fill for add session. It really needs templating, manual data-entry makes it unusable.
    
    Can I make the displays stackable?

    Visualise tonnage data as a graph?
    Calendar widget.

    ? Limit date range of data fed to tonnage functions.

    How to persist state preferences?

Tonnage:
scheme === linear: reps * sets * mass
scheme === pyramid: mass * 0.8 * 10 + mass * 0.85 * 6 + mass * 0.9 * 3 + mass * 0.95 * 1
reps / sets = 20 / 8 = 2.5  is default, percentage deviation from this ratio is multiplied into the tonnage to approximate mass tonnage. ie Lower rep/set is assumed to mean higher mass, and therefore increases mass tonnage, higher decreases it. Also, reps / 20 multiplies in as well, to reward higher rep tonnage.
Therefore, rep tonnage is accurate, standard pyramid scheme is accurate, tonnage quality is accurate, and mass tonnage is approximate. AND all values are used fruitfully in calculations.
