DONE - I want a filter sessions by exercise feature.
DONE - I want the database to accept floats for the mass entry.
DONE - Fix the add component for accepting floats as well.
DONE - Fix the add component by removing duplication of code.
I want a calendar visualisation of sessions feature.
DONE - I want the scheme to generate a tonnage data point.
    I want to display the tonnage by session
    I want to display the tonnage by week
    by month
    by input interval
        Having to split interval and format multiplies the amount of manual coding, can I fix this?
            I'm not sure that I have a superior solution to the one I've got now. I'll wait before working anymore on this.
    Working on the month...
        I need to be able to group SIDs by month... create an array of arrays, which contain the sids belonging to each month.
        











Tonnage:
scheme === linear: reps * sets * mass
scheme === pyramid: mass * 0.8 * 10 + mass * 0.85 * 6 + mass * 0.9 * 3 + mass * 0.95 * 1
reps / sets = 20 / 8 = 2.5  is default, percentage deviation from this ratio is multiplied into the tonnage to approximate mass tonnage. ie Lower rep/set is assumed to mean higher mass, and therefore increases mass tonnage, higher decreases it. Also, reps / 20 multiplies in as well, to reward higher rep tonnage.
Therefore, rep tonnage is accurate, standard pyramid scheme is accurate, tonnage quality is accurate, and mass tonnage is approximate. AND all values are used fruitfully in calculations.
