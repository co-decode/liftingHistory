DONE - I want a filter sessions by exercise feature.
DONE - I want the database to accept floats for the mass entry.
DONE - Fix the add component for accepting floats as well.
DONE - Fix the add component by removing duplication of code.
DONE - I want the scheme to generate a tonnage data point.
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by session
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by week
    DONE by month

    !!! My mass tonnage formula is massively incorrect.
     DONE Better to have manual input of tonnage, or to input average mass, average reps per set.
    DONE Having to split interval and format multiplies the amount of manual coding, can I fix this?

        ?  - Pretty sure weekly and monthly is fine. 
            Program cycle intervals might be interesting, but I'll leave a feature like that until I actually need it.
        ? Limit date range of data fed to tonnage functions - Not sure I want to do that... it's a performance concern, but I don't see a problem right now. Did I want to limit the range of get data queried for in the Log component? No.
        
    Done: Fix the edit component.
     Finished: The sets input and the reps, mass and variation inputs.
     Finished: Fix the add lift fieldset...

    DONE: Auto-fill for add session. It really needs templating, manual data-entry makes it unusable.
    
    DONE: Fix Tonnage

    DONE: Aggregate tonnage data by custom interval

    DONE: Can I remove duplication between the tonnage functions?

    DONE: Add another input to the tonnage component to allow for custom intervals and beginning reference date

    DONE: Can I make the displays stackable?

    ? Can I filter the display of each exercise?
    ?? Would I want to flip the mapping order to see interval then exercises?
    ->> Filter SIDS by variation tag.
    ->> Add option to view intervals with zeroes.
        

    ->> Build a session breakdown component
        DONE: I want to visualise average quality with average max mass, and average reps/sets.
        

    Visualise tonnage data as a graph?

Tonnage:
scheme === linear: reps * sets * mass
scheme === pyramid: mass * 0.8 * 10 + mass * 0.85 * 6 + mass * 0.9 * 3 + mass * 0.95 * 1
reps / sets = 20 / 8 = 2.5  is default, percentage deviation from this ratio is multiplied into the tonnage to approximate mass tonnage. ie Lower rep/set is assumed to mean higher mass, and therefore increases mass tonnage, higher decreases it. Also, reps / 20 multiplies in as well, to reward higher rep tonnage.
Therefore, rep tonnage is accurate, standard pyramid scheme is accurate, tonnage quality is accurate, and mass tonnage is approximate. AND all values are used fruitfully in calculations.
