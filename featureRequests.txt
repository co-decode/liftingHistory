FIXED BUG: After editing a session, the log display order is reset. Fix the Reverse button state.

FIXED BUG: fixed untouched date field from offsetting by the timezone on submission
    - unchanged edit submission is possible, but this seems benign.
     
POTENTIAL ISSUE: The deployed Heroku container of the Server has a CORS allowance for the non-container Server. I meant to point CORS to itself.
    ie. IS "https://node-lifting-history2.herokuapp.com" - SHOULD BE "https://lifting-history-2-container.herokuapp.com"
        Perhaps this is an incorrect assumption on my part. I should experiment with taking it out altogether if it is in fact unnecessary.
    SOLUTION: Seems to be unnecessary, removing in v3.


VERSION 3:

    DONE: alter get function to - 1 - rename 'date' to 'sessions' - 2 - dynamically create an exercise call based on existing entries.
            FIXED ERROR: No existing sessions throws an error and crashes server.
    DONE: Set up more exercises. Here is the current list:
            BIG ONES:
            - Bench    - Deadlift    - Squat    - Overhead Press    - Bicep    - Tricep    - Grip    - Calf    - Lunge    - Rows    - Shrugs
            - Pull Up    - Push up    - Dips    - Abs    - Lateral Raise    - Good Morning    - Face Pull    - Hip Thrusters    - Hip Abduction
            - Hip Adduction    - Reverse Flies    - Rotator Cuff    - Pull Over    - Neck    - Nordic    - Reverse Nordic    - Leg Curl
            - Flies    - Back Extension    

            And if anything is important enough, I can just make another category...
        DONE: Add these tables to the database.
        DONE: Alter Add component to allow entries into the new tables
        DONE: Fix the client side, so that it is looking into the sessions property, not the date
        DONE: Fix the limited exercise call... use that global variable... or construct the array from exercise properties
            (could also send the unique array down from the server... but it shouldn't be too expensive to go Object.keys(get.exercises))
        DONE: Alter the Edit components to allow any exercises
        DONE: Fix the Tonnage and Graph logic to accumulate correctly.

        DONE: Add variations

        // Tonnage

        DONE: Filter tonnage by exercise, don't want to see 27 difference exercises, all repeated by date.
        DONE: Zeroes still show for tonnage table
        
        DONE: Maybe mix and match exercise combinations into the accumulator, shouldn't be too hard programmatically
        DONE: IN LOG - Then variation filters need to be extended / improved, checkboxes to see multiple variations at a time
        DONE fix varMenu staying open when hide all and show all is toggled.


        DONE FIX key errors in log and tonnage

        DONE FIX error when redirected to log on submit of Add -- React is so broken, randomly decided it would fix itself, probably updating finally after a change I made ages ago.

        DONE FIX Add component allows resubmission of unchanged entry still.
        DONE FIX delete for all exercises

        DONE Extend variation entry to permit custom entries 
            DONE Test and make sure it works with the edit component, and all the others... the filters are going to need it as well, they are currently pulling from the global variationsObject
        DONE Add custom entry feature to the Edit component
                DONE: Allowed to add to tags of the same value to the edit component
                DONE: Edit component not filtering existing tags for customs.
                DONE: Can add missing mandatory fields now
                DONE: Can add custom fields...
                DONE: Allow new customs to be added.
                DONE: Fix the add exercise forms.

        DONE optional and mandatory variation entries


        // Variation Filtering

        Cannot filter by variation for Graph... may be a desirable functionality.


        // JSON to entry

        Experiment with reading a JSON file, or text stream, and auto-filling the Add and Edit forms.


        Would require major refactoring, but I could tag each set with a variation template, and make it reasonably quick to assign in entry.

        >> Then go work on the sheet music project.

    DONE: Experiment with the Accumulator logic for the Tonnage and Graph components, try to limit the number of times through the whole function to once for the three datasets.
