DONE - I want a filter sessions by exercise feature.
DONE - I want the database to accept floats for the mass entry.
DONE - Fix the add component for accepting floats as well.
DONE - Fix the add component by removing duplication of code.
DONE - I want the scheme to generate a tonnage data point.
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by session
    DONE I want to display the tonnage by week
    DONE by month

    !!! My mass tonnage formula is massively incorrect.
     DONE Better to have manual input of tonnage, or to input average mass, average reps per set.
    DONE Having to split interval and format multiplies the amount of manual coding, can I fix this?
     
    ARCHIVES
        ?  - Pretty sure weekly and monthly is fine. 
            Program cycle intervals might be interesting, but I'll leave a feature like that until I actually need it.
        ? Limit date range of data fed to tonnage functions - Not sure I want to do that... it's a performance concern, but I don't see a problem right now. Did I want to limit the range of get data queried for in the Log component? No.
        
    Done: Fix the edit component.
     Finished: The sets input and the reps, mass and variation inputs.
     Finished: Fix the add lift fieldset...

    DONE: Auto-fill for add session. It really needs templating, manual data-entry makes it unusable.
    
    DONE: Fix Tonnage

    DONE: Aggregate tonnage data by custom interval

    DONE: Can I remove duplication between the tonnage functions?

    DONE: Add another input to the tonnage component to allow for custom intervals and beginning reference date

    DONE: Can I make the displays stackable?

    DONE: Can I filter the display of each exercise?
    ?? NO... Would I want to flip the mapping order to see interval then exercises?
    DONE: Add option to view intervals with zeroes.        
    DONE: Build a session breakdown component
    DONE: I want to visualise average quality with average max mass, and average reps/sets.   

    DONE: Filter SIDS by variation tag. DONE FOR Tonnage... might like it for the LOG as well.

    !! Show Zeroes has problems, it doesn't add zeroes to display all intervals, it only shows zeroes where a session id exists, but that exercise does not. It may be better to eliminate it, and seek to display time continuity with the graphs. 
    I have fixed this for the graphs... I think that zeroes can be thrown out now.

    DONE Tonnage Line Graphs with ChartJS:    
        DONE I want a custom interval option.
        DONE All exercises choice for all interval options.
        DONE Difference in totalling function is incorrect
        DONE getLabels function does not take into account exercise for visualisation
        DONE Filter date range for the graph entry, so that I don't have 6 million points on the graph.
        DONE I should refactor a lot of my functions to make them more space efficient, if possible.

    DONE for now... Calendar HeatMap
        DONE Calendar correctly displays 42 days, with the current month being correctly offset to its starting day, having the correct amount of days, and displaying the previous and next months, correctly displaying their dates.
        DONE I want the squares to fill based on which exercises were performed on that day.
        DONE I want to be able to click on a filled square, and be taken to its breakdown page.
        DONE Going back to the calendar from the breakdown page will bring you to the correct month that that session was recorded on.
        The Calendar needs to be improved in terms of looks, but I might just keep it like this... I don't really wish to care that much.

    DONE Go to Edit from Breakdown Page

    DONE Fix the double Date entry.

    DONE Put the Tonnage table into a gridbox

    DONE password should be in a password type input, so that the plain text is hidden. Hideable is probably nice.
